# A simple 1-page app that shows all [Geek&Poke](http://geek-and-poke.com/) cartoons

Do not bother to build it. Just got to: https://rawgit.com/owidder/gapall/master/angular/index.html

Otherwise:
* clone this repo
* go into the 'angular' folder
* bower install
* that's it (hopefully)

In the 'node' folder is a node.js script to downloadd the images from the blog

Have fun!
